        <h1>Commentary: Did Duterte Outsmart PNP, Marcos Administration?</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This post is not mine, but I agree with most of its assumptions. I credited the author below.</p>
        <p>It is no secret that former President Rodrigo "Rody" Duterte has long been a master strategist in politics.</p>
        <p>And with what transpired yesterday—his immediate transfer to the Netherlands without following proper legal procedures—it seems clear that he has successfully executed a carefully laid trap for the current administration and the Philippine National Police (PNP).</p>
        <h2>Violation of the Rome Statute and the "Poisonous Tree" Doctrine</h2>
        <p>One of the most crucial aspects of the International Criminal Court (ICC) process is compliance with Article 59(3) of the Rome Statute...</p>
        <blockquote>"I understand them because this is their job. This is why it has come to an end."</blockquote>
        <h2>Duterte’s Strategy: Why Did He Let This Happen?</h2>
        <p>Many are asking: Why didn’t Duterte resist? Why did he seem to accept it so easily?</p>
        <h2>How the Marcos Administration and PNP Fell into the Trap</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PNP’s Compliance Without Due Process – Instead of ensuring Duterte’s case passed through Philippine courts, they immediately surrendered him to the ICC, violating the very laws they are supposed to uphold.</li>
            <li>Government Inaction – The Marcos administration did nothing to assert Philippine sovereignty or insist on the proper legal process, further highlighting its weakness on the global stage.</li>
            <li>Strengthening the Argument of ICC Bias – By blatantly violating Article 59(3), the case against Duterte now fuels claims that the ICC is politically motivated and only targets leaders who are not aligned with Western powers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Could Happen Next?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ UN Security Council Intervention – Countries like Russia and China could move to suspend the ICC’s proceedings against Duterte, citing the violation of Article 59(3) as a legal basis.</li>
            <li>✅ Collapse of ICC Credibility – If the ICC pushes forward with the case despite these legal flaws, it risks further losing its legitimacy, especially if it is exposed as a political tool rather than an impartial court.</li>
            <li>✅ Legal Basis for Case Dismissal – Under the "fruits of a poisonous tree" doctrine, Duterte’s case could be thrown out entirely, securing him an unprecedented legal victory even while in the Netherlands.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>A Masterful Strategy?</h2>
        <p>At first glance, some may see Duterte as the loser in this situation.</p>
        <p>But upon closer analysis, it appears he may actually be the true winner...</p>
        <p>Good luck, President BBM and PNP.</p>
