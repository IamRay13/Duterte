            <h2>Accountability and Tax Reforms</h2>
            <p>During Duterte's presidency, several businesses were publicly called out for tax-related issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mighty Corporation:</strong> Accused of using fake tax stamps to evade taxes, resulting in a settlement of nearly ₱30 billion. The settlement was part of a deal that included the sale of Mighty Corporation's assets to Japan Tobacco International. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.rappler.com/business/184501-philippines-mighty-corp-settle-tax-case/">here</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Philippine Airlines (PAL):</strong> Faced scrutiny over unpaid tax liabilities amounting to ₱6 billion, which were settled within the deadline set by Duterte. PAL's president at the time, Jaime Bautista, mentioned that the payment was financed through additional debt.

                <li><strong>ABS-CBN Corporation:</strong> Criticized for alleged unpaid taxes and franchise issues, although the company maintained that it had settled its tax obligations. ABS-CBN emphasized that it regularly pays its taxes and even received a Tax Clearance Certificate from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).

            <h2>Protecting Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)</h2>
            <p>Duterte made strong statements regarding the protection of OFWs, particularly in Kuwait. He once said:</p>
            <blockquote>
                "One more incident about being a woman, a Filipina worker being raped there, committing suicide, I’m going to stop. I’m going to ban [deployment] there."
            </blockquote>
            <p>He emphasized the dignity of Filipino workers, stating:</p>
            <blockquote>
                "We are poor, we may need your help, but we will not do it at the expense of the dignity of the Filipino."
            </blockquote>
            <p>Kuwait initially expressed concern over Duterte's remarks and the temporary ban on OFW deployment. Tensions escalated after a controversial rescue operation by the Philippine Embassy, leading to the expulsion of the Philippine Ambassador. However, both nations eventually resolved the conflict by signing a bilateral labor agreement in 2018. This agreement included provisions for better working conditions, such as guaranteed rest days and the right to keep personal documents.

        <section>
            <h2>Environmental Rehabilitation</h2>
            <h3>Manila Bay Rehabilitation</h3>
            <p>Dubbed the "Battle for Manila Bay," this initiative aimed to restore the bay's water quality and included large-scale cleanup drives and the installation of the controversial "dolomite beach."</p>

            <h3>Boracay Rehabilitation</h3>
            <p>In 2018, Duterte ordered the temporary closure of Boracay Island to address severe environmental degradation. The rehabilitation resulted in a cleaner and more sustainable Boracay, setting a benchmark for eco-tourism.</p>

            <h3>Other Cleanup Efforts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Baguio City:</strong> Addressed overdevelopment and environmental degradation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pasig River:</strong> Revitalization projects aimed to restore water quality and relocate informal settlers.</li>
                <li><strong>El Nido and Coron (Palawan):</strong> Focused on regulating tourist numbers and enforcing environmental laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Cebu's Coastal Areas:</strong> Cleaned up coastal areas and promoted sustainable tourism.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Controversies and Legal Challenges</h2>
            <p>Duterte is currently facing legal challenges, including an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged crimes against humanity. This situation has sparked significant political, legal, and diplomatic reactions, both in the Philippines and internationally.</p>
